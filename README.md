This repository includes R codes used in modeling and analyses of master's thesis project **Adaptive Rewiring on Coupled Logistic Maps with Heterogeneous Parameters** at KU Leuven, supervised by Prof. Cees van Leeuwen.

Thesis text (along with simulated model files and visualizations) are accessible on the Open Science Framework (doi:[10.17605/osf.io/625D8](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/625D8)).

Although the scripts within this repository suffice for reproducing the outcomes, they are not well-documented—and by no means self-explanatory—and surely needs quite some code-cleaning. Thus, feel free to contact me in case you intend to re-run the analyses.

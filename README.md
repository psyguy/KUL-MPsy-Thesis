Due to technical issues, the commits of June could not be pushed to the remote repo, as a result the repo was renamed and now has a fresh start here.

The June commits (until 2019-06-12) are now only accessible locally, and the pre-June 2019 commits can be found on the [old repo](https://github.com/psyguy/Thesis-Codes-old).
